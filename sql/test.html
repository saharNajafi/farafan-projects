                <h3>(Describe a time when you had a problem with a piece of equipment (for ex: TV</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:<br>
                • What equipment it was<br>
                • What problem you had<br>
                • When you had the problem<br>
                And explain how you fixed the problem</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>I would like to tell you the story about the time I had some technical problems with my<br>
                mother’s phone.<br>
                I cannot remember exactly when it happened, probably a couple of years back when<br>
                I was still a high-school student. Anyway, back in the day, smart phones were not as<br>
                popular as they are now, and owning one was actually something to be jealous of.<br>
                On my mom’s birthday that year, my dad surprised her with a brand new iPhone 4, which<br>
                was one of the most technically advanced phones on the market at the time. Although<br>
                I knew it was mom’s, I just loved it so much, all I wanted to do was bringing it to school<br>
                to show my friends. Then one day, I made up an excuse that I need her phone for some<br>
                projects at school and she actually believed me.<br>
                I remember the next morning; I couldn’t help smiling all the way to school with the<br>
                phone in my pocket. Needless to say how much my friends adored it, and for me, I just<br>
                loved being the center of attention. As we were playing with the phone, testing all of<br>
                its functions, my teacher walked in, which took me by surprise. Next thing I know, my<br>
                mom’s phone slipped out of my hand and fell onto the hard floor. My heart missed a<br>
                beat as I picked it up, there was no screen crack but the flash-light just kept flashing<br>
                non-stop. I thought to myself: “That’s it, this is the end of the world for me.”<br>
                Later that day, I brought the phone home and confessed with my mom. She was furious<br>
                with me. But it turned out that all I had to do was hitting the reset button!<br>
                This is one of the memories that I could never forget. </p>

                <h3>1. What are the common household appliances that every family has?</h3><br><p>Hmm... I think every family would have some basic household appliances like refrigerators,<br>
                washing machines for housework or Televisions for entertaining purposes. Those are the<br>
                types of equipment that offer people a lot of benefits and could help save a lot of time.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What can people do to protect their equipment from being broken?</h3><br><p>Of course if you want to keep anything new, or at least not broken, you have to treat<br>
                it carefully. For example, if you want to keep a refrigerator in its best condition for the<br>
                longest time possible, you should clean it regularly, have it repaired right away if any<br>
                problems occur.</p>
                <br><h3>3. If a piece of equipment is broken, do you prefer to fix it or buy a new one?</h3><br><p>This should depend on how broken it is. If there are still chances that it would function<br>
                normally again after being repaired, I would definitely try and fix it. But on the other<br>
                hand, if chances are it can’t be fixed or the repairing process could cost me a fortune,<br>
                then I would buy a new one. </p>
                <br><h3>4. Do you think modern technology makes people lazier?</h3><br><p>Yes, I think so. Everything is so convenient these days that people no longer have to<br>
                make much of an effort anymore. Online shopping or delivery services are a prime<br>
                example. Back in the day, to buy something, people had no choice but to travel to the<br>
                store and made the purchase in person. But now, as these online services are always<br>
                available, anything could be bought with just a click. This does make people lazier, but<br>
                at the same time helps people save tons of time.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a (long) car journey you went on</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>where you went<br>
                    what you did at this place<br>

                    And explain why you went on that journey by car</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>On Norooz holiday two years ago, my family went to an island near my city by car. The island was interconnected with the mainland with a bridge, so we could drive all the way there. On the island, we went to the beach, where we went swimming, built sandcastles and took lots of pictures. In the evening, we went to have seafood at the famous night market. The street was packed with people and we had to wait in a line for a table. But the food was totally worth it. My parents decided to drive there because it was difficult to get around on the island without a car. Besides, it was a one-day trip, we wanted to be home early in the evening, so driving seemed to be the best option. It turned out to be a great decision, because it felt so great when we were driving along the coastal roads with the music on and ocean breeze on our faces.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Why do people like to have private cars?</h3><br><p>There are many reasons why people like to have private cars. Firstly, with a car, it would be much easier to get around. It can save us a lot of time. Secondly, a lot of people, especially guys, enjoy driving. They like the feeling of sitting in their private car and having everything under their control. Lastly, a car can bring a lot of fun to our life. We can have a road trip with friends or family in our cars.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What are the differences between bicycles and private cars?</h3><br><p>I have to say that there are many differences between them. Bicycles are more environmentally friendly. And riding bicycles is a good exercise. It's a great choice for short distance trips and it's easy and free to park. However, cars have more room, which allows more people to travel in it. And it's definitely better to drive a car if you want to travel long distances.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Is it a good thing that everyone has their own cars?</h3><br><p>I don't think so. Even though cars make people's life easier, it would be a disaster if everyone has their own car. The traffic in Iran is already very terrible, especially in big cities. It would most definitely be paralyzed if everyone owns a car. And the parking would be a huge problem. So I think instead of encouraging people to buy more car, governments should pay more attention to improving public transportation system.</p>
                <br><h3>4. How to buy private cars in Iran?</h3><br><p>I've never bought a car myself. But as far as I know, there are the following steps. First, you go to the car stores to choose a brand and model you want to purchase. Then, you make a down payment. After that, you wait until they inform you to go pick up the car. Finally, you pay your taxes and buy insurance for it. I think that's pretty much it.</p>
                <br><h3>5. What's the difference between men and women's preference on cars?</h3><br><p>As far as I know, there truly are some very noticeable differences. One is that, women tend to like smaller cars, while men like big ones. So, many women are fans of small sized cars like Mini Cooper and Smart, probably because it's easier to drive and park. And big SUVs usually appeal to men. Another thing is that, women think the appearance of a car is more important than its performance, and men think otherwise. I think it's in their blood.</p>
                <br><h3>6. What will cars be like in the future?</h3><br><p>To begin with, I think cars will be fancier and more beautiful. When I go to the car exhibition, I can see some concept cars. I think they give us an idea how cars will look like. Secondly, I think more functions and features will be added, as we have seen in Sci -Fi movies. Maybe it can float on water and even fly in the sky. Lastly, cars will definitely be more eco-friendly. I mean, renewable energy like solar energy will replace fossil fuels. To be frank, I can't wait to see how cars will get in the future.</p>

                <h3>Describe a book you have recently read</h3>
                <p></p><p>:You should say<br>
                • What kind of book it is<br>
                • What it is about<br>
                • What sort of people would enjoy it<br>
                And explain why you liked it</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>I am a bookworm so when it comes to describing a book I read, I am really confused<br>
                since I don’t know which one to choose, but I will tell you about the book that I have just<br>
                finished most recently – Angel and Demon – a bestselling mystery-thriller novel written<br>
                by Dan Brown.<br>
                The whole story revolves around the protagonist named Robert Langon who is on a<br>
                quest to rescue Popes and discover underlying mysteries of the Catholic church. Though<br>
                the book involves a lot of religious issues, it can cater to all kinds of readers as there<br>
                aren’t many technical terms. From my point of view, it is a true masterpiece, enchanting<br>
                and captivating, filled with conspiracies and plot twists that really send shiver down my<br>
                spine. I was so fascinated by the book that I had to find the film adaptation online to<br>
                watch afterwards, and it did not let me down at all. The movie was so action-packed<br>
                that it kept me on the edge of my seat.<br>
                What I especially like about the book is that it is very thought provoking and it kept me<br>
                thinking for a very long time after I had already finished reading. I appreciate the moral<br>
                lessons of the book. The story, though may sound distant to our lives, conveys meanings<br>
                that are relatable to readers, and I am grateful that I learnt something from the book.<br>
                All in all, it is an outstanding book that I would definitely recommend to my friends.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. What kind of books do children like?</h3><br><p>I’m not sure, but I guess they enjoy fairy tales and folk stories since the plots are usually<br>
                quite bright. For example, most kids read Cinderella and love the book very much. I<br>
                guess it is because it has beautiful characters and a happy ending. </p>
                <br><h3>2. What should parents do to encourage their children to read books?</h3><br><p>It is necessary that parents encourage their children’s reading activities at an early age.<br>
                This can help kids develop a habit of reading for pleasure. Also, parents should not be<br>
                too controlling over the books their children read, let them do what they like and read<br>
                what they love will keep them more interested in reading.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Why do adults still have to read books?</h3><br><p>I think because people can learn a lot from reading books, as books not only are stressrelieving but also enrich one’s soul and enhance one’s knowledge, and learning is a<br>
                process of a lifetime. For that reason, people of all ages still read books.</p>
                <br><h3>4. How will reading change in the future?</h3><br><p>Owing to the development of technology, paper books may be a thing of the past as<br>
                digital books are taking over. Online reading through devices such as laptop, mobile<br>
                phones and kindles are now favored since it is much more convenient. However, I can’t<br>
                really tell because many of my friends still enjoy the feeling of having a book in their<br>
                hands. </p>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>The city I really want to live in is Kyoto city, which is situated in the central area of Japan, not far from Osaka. Kyoto is a perfect combination of natural beauty as well as cultural heritage. Every spring, thousands of tourists visit this amazing city for its cherry blossom. Apart from that, the city is filled with temples and shrines dating back to centuries ago. They are perfect examples of the ancient Japanese architecture. I want to live there in the future with my husband (wife). Together we could explore all the interesting things the city has to offer. In order to achieve this dream, I need to first of all improve my Japanese proficiency, because life would be really difficult if I can't get my message across to the local people. Moreover, saving a decent amount of money would be necessary because Japan is quite an expensive country. But I think it would be worthwhile if I can live there, even just for a couple of years.</p>

                <h3>1. Do you like to live alone or share a room with others?</h3><br><p>To be honest, I prefer living alone and having the apartment to myself. It's not that I don't like to make friends or share things with people, but I do enjoy having more privacy. And if I live alone, I don't have to worry about bothering my roommate whenever I have to come home late at night.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What are the advantages and the disadvantages of living alone?</h3><br><p>The advantage is that you can get more privacy. So, you can feel more relaxed at home without having to be careful not to disturb anyone. Of course, there are disadvantages too. For instance, when you forget your key at home, instead of calling a roommate, you have to turn to a locksmith for help.</p>
                <br><h3>3. What are the advantages of working abroad?</h3><br><p>When working in another country, one can get to know the culture of that country well, because interacting with the local people is the best way to learn it. Another advantage is that picking up the language would become much easier, because like it or not, you are surrounded by it. Besides, people will become more independent living far away from home.</p>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>The photo I'm going to tell you about is taken by my mother when we were on holiday in Mazandaran last October. We went to Chalous, a very beautiful city in northern Iran. We stayed at a sea view hotel, so we had an easy access to the beautiful sandy beach. One evening, we were relaxing on the beach after dinner. Just as the sun was setting, the sea was glistening, and the clouds were getting dark. It was an amazing sight. I took out my phone and took a great picture of the sight. I didn't know my mother was taking a picture of me at that very moment until she showed me later. In this picture, I was standing on the sand and looking at the beautiful sea with my cellphone is my hands. I loved it very much, so I asked my mother to send it to me. This picture was unforgettable because I only get to meet my mother twice a year now, and that holiday we spent together was a great memory for both of us.</p>

                <h3>1. What kind of picture would you like to hang in your bedroom?</h3><br><p>I would choose a photograph of the whole family in my bedroom. Bedroom is quite a private space, I would like to make it cozy and comfortable as my wish. And families always back me up whenever I run into difficulties. So, I would like to see them every morning I open my eyes.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Why do some people like taking photos, some don't?</h3><br><p>Well, people are different. Some people like to appreciate the beauty in daily life and record them with their cameras, while some other people prefer looking at the scenery with their own eyes. There are also some people who are not very artistic. They can't take very good pictures, therefore they don't bother.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do you like taking photos?</h3><br><p>Yes, I do. I'm a fan of photography. Although I can't afford to have professional cameras, I do enjoy taking pictures with my phone. Because of the ever-improving cameras on the smartphones, we can take amazing shots with our phones wherever we go.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do you like to be photographed by strangers?</h3><br><p>Not really, because I' m not sure what they will do with the picture. They may use our pictures for wrong or even illegal purposes. So, in order to avoid potential problems, I don't like to be photographed by strangers. You know, better safe than sorry.</p>

                <h3>Describe a memorable story told by someone</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>Who told you the story<br>
                    When you heard the story<br>
                    What the story was about<br>
                    And explain why you found it memorable </p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>The story that I remember quite clearly is called the Race Between the Hare and the Tortoise. It was told by my father when I was about 5 or 6 years old. The story goes like this: An arrogant hare thought he was the fastest animal in the forest. Quite interestingly, a tortoise wanted to challenge him. The hare laughed very hard because it sounded very ridiculous to him. The tortoise wanted to have a race with him. The race attracted all the animals in the forest. A starting line was made and off the hare and tortoise went. The hare was very fast, so he was far ahead, then he took a rest. The tortoise, however, kept moving forward slowly but surely. By the time the tortoise came up, his opponent was sleeping. The hare didn't wake up until it was too late. The winner was the tortoise. It's a quite simple but meaningful story. It's memorable because the end was very surprising. It also teaches us that, as long as we stick to our goals, we will reach it, no matter what.</p>

                <h3>1. What books would you recommend young people to read?</h3><br><p>The Alchemist. This book inspired me greatly in my hour of darkness. It was a simple and short story: a shepherd boy how to realize his dream. First sold his sheep, then left his hometown and traveled to Egypt. He was fooled and beat along the journey, but he didn't give up. Finally, he took the coveted treasure. I recommend this book to young people, because I want them to remember one thing: if you really desire for something, just go for it. Do not let others' opinions influence you.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What kind of stories do children like?</h3><br><p>Generally speaking, children are more into fairy tales, because fairy tales are usually easy to understand and there are cute figures in the stories, like an animal character or a lovely princess. I guess that's why Disney movies are always children's favorite.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do you think it's important for parents to read bedtime stories for their children?</h3><br><p>Yes, it's very necessary for parents to do so, and it's a sweet thing to do. It can not only help children learn about language and culture but also develop their interest in literature. Besides, children will be closer to their parents if their parents are willing to spend time with them.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do you think reading benefits us or not?</h3><br><p>Definitely yes. Reading can help us learn a language, because the words authors use are very good materials for improving our language skills. Apart from that, different kinds of books can offer us knowledge about different topics and can provide us instructions in many aspects of life.</p>
                <br><h3>5. How to keep reading habits in your busy life?</h3><br><p>I don't have a whole period of time, but more time confetti. So, I will take great advantage of this brief time, like glancing the daily news while waiting for a bus, or listening the pay program while on the subway. And I can always read something I like before going to bed.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a piece of technology (not computer-related) you like to use</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>What the technology is<br>
                    When it was invented<br>
                    What it is used for<br>
                    And explain how you feel about it</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>This piece of technology that I really like using is Dyson vacuum cleaner, an electric appliance. I don't know exactly when it was invented, to be honest. Regular vacuum cleaners may have been around for many decades, but it seems like the Dyson ones have only been in the market for a couple of years. Unlike the ordinary vacuum cleaners, which are very clumsy, this product looks kind of like a machine gun. It's portable and handy. It can not only be used for cleaning the floor, but also for sanitizing pillows, sofa cushions and things like that. It's very easy to use. I only have to point the head of it to the place or things that need to be cleaned and then pull the trigger, just like firing a gun and the dirt will be sucked into the cleaner easily. I think it's a very useful invention, because it saves a lot of manual and labor work for me. Cleaning the house has now become relaxing or even fun . I'm grateful for this piece of technology.</p>

                <h3>1. Do you think that technology always has positive effects?</h3><br><p>Technology has its pros and cons. On the one hand, we have an easy access to the lessons that interest us, which will increase our overall knowledge. But if we spend too much time being entertained on the Internet, playing computer games or chatting on line, for instance, then we are more likely to become lazy and aggressive.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Do you agree that men are more obsessed with new technology than women?</h3><br><p>Generally, it is true that men are more addicted to new technology than women. There are more male computer programmers than the female ones around me. And they would like to talk about the latest technology, like iPhone X, Apple Watch and Mac with great enthusiasm.</p>
                <br><h3>3. How to teach older generation to use new technology?</h3><br><p>Personally, one of the important steps before teaching older generation should be letting them embrace technology. As a matter of fact, most senior citizens have phobia for technology, be it the computers, Internet or the iPod. So, if we manage to let them pick up new things, technology can be effectively learned.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Is there any difference between technology in cities and in small towns?</h3><br><p>I think the difference is that some new technologies appear first in big cities before they gain their popularity in smaller towns. And as people in small towns are getting richer, they now have almost equal access to technology, which is a good example of social equality.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do you like to use new technology?</h3><br><p>Yes, I do. I'm a big fan of new technology and new gadgets, such as smart phones and tablets. It always makes me very excited when there's a new product coming out. These new products are often user-friendly and can make our life better.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a place where you often visit with your friends or family</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>Where the place is<br>
                    How you know the place<br>
                    How you go there<br>
                    And explain why you want to visit this place</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>One place that I go with my family on a regular basis is a seaside urban park in our city. It is on the seaside, which is only about 10-minute walk from our home. Since the news said that a new park would be built there several years ago, my family had been waiting for its completion. As it is very close, the best way to get there is on foot. The park is big and very beautiful. There are enormous lawns in it for families to have picnics. There is also a very long track along the shore for running. It's nice to go there for a jog whenever we have time. In the evenings, we can see some families building sand castles or looking for sea crabs on the sand. My family like to visit this park because it's a nice and peaceful place for us to forget the hustle and bustle in life and spend some quality time together.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Do you like to hang out with your friends?</h3><br><p>Yes. I love to hang out with them. On weekends, we eat out together or go to the movies, or even just chat without doing anything in particular. It's great to have some good friends to hang out with, because you can share your happiness and sorrow with each other. I think that's what friends are for.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What do you think is the most important thing of being friends?</h3><br><p>I think the most important thing is being supportive. We should understand our friends' needs and genuinely support them. True friends are good listeners and they will always stand behind us. Otherwise, they are just fair-weather friends.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do you think that technology makes it easier to make new friends?</h3><br><p>Yes. With the advancement of technology, there appeared many new applications for meeting new people, especially people with common interests. There are also some online forums or virtual communities where people can make new friends, but we have to be cautious not to make wrong friends.</p>
                <br><h3>4. How could people find reliable friends on the Internet?</h3><br><p>I haven't tried making new friends on the Internet. But I think from the conversations we had, I can have a general understanding of who he is, what he likes, and then decide he is a reliable friend or not.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do you like to make friends with older people?</h3><br><p>Yes, I like to make friends with older people. They have different views about life and they have gone through much than I did, so they know more than I do. Making friends with them is a blessing for me.</p>

            <dd style="display: block;">
                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a place you know where people go to listen to music (such as a theatre or a music hall)</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>Where it is<br>
                    What kind of music is performed there<br>
                    What type of people go there<br>
                    Why people go there<br>
                    And explain your impressions of this place</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>The place I want to talk about is the symphony hall which is situated in the center of my city. Famous orchestras and musicians from home and abroad perform classical music there. I went there once with my parents to listen to an Azeri orchestra. The sound effect in the hall was amazing! I was overwhelmed by the vigorous melodies. Even after I left, the music still sounded in my ears and heart. I noticed that most people who went to the symphony hall are people my parents age, maybe in their late forties. Not many young people go there, because perhaps it takes more life experience to truly understand and enjoy classical music. People go there when their favorite orchestra or operas are playing, or when they feel stressed from work and life. The music resonating in the hall can calm people down and give them inspirations. When I was in the hall, I felt that it was a solemn and magnificent place. It gave me a better understanding of classical music.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Should children learn to play instrument?</h3><br><p>Yes. I think they should, because learning to play an instrument can practice children's coordination of movements, improve their appreciation for the arts and even boost their academic performances. It can give them a better understanding of music and make them enjoy music more. Besides, playing an instrument can be a social skill when they grow up, and life will be less boring with it.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Should parents force them to learn music?</h3><br><p>I don' t think so. Children should not be forced to do anything, instead they should be guided. Even though learning music has a lot of benefits, it will be painful for a kid if he is forced to do it. Parents should observe their children more and guide them according to their nature. If parents know the tricks, they can develop their children's interest in music.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Is music education important in your country?</h3><br><p>I'm afraid it isn't. In most schools, teachers merely lead the students to sing songs. Music theories are not taught, so schools are not likely to cultivate future musicians. But these years, more parents send their children to training centers to receive professional music training, which is a good thing.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Some people say music is like math, do you agree?</h3><br><p>I think it makes sense. I once heard that beneath the sound of music notes were the math concepts and rules. When I take a closer look, they do have a lot in common. Musicians sometimes count out the numbers of beats before they play. Just as a mathematician once said: Music is a secret exercise in arithmetic of the soul, unaware of its act of counting.</p>
                <br><h3>5. What effects does technology have on music?</h3><br><p>Technology has improved our experience with music in many different ways. Thanks to technology, music companies and studios can record music of a much better quality with new equipment. The music can be very clear and noise free. Apart from that, earphone companies made earphones that are light or even wireless, at the same time with great sound effects, allowing us to have wonderful music experiences that we never had before.</p>
                <br><h3>6. What are the advantages of learning music?</h3><br><p>Learning music can bring many benefits. To start with, it can be a pleasant experience and help us relieve our stress, because music is beautiful and can touch our souls. Secondly, it can improve our appreciation and taste for the arts. Thirdly, it can make us more confident, imagine what it feels like when we can play some cool music at a party with friends.</p>

                <h3>Describe a public place that you think needs improvements</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>Where this public place is<br>
                    What it is like<br>
                    Why you think it needs improvements<br>
                    And explain how to make it better</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>The place I'm going to tell you about is an abandoned park near where I live. It's located in a residential area. So, it's supposed to be a place where people enjoy spending their free time. However, it's not the case. The park occupies an area of around 1000 square meters, which is quite big. It's a shame that it's very poorly equipped. There are just some trees standing on the dry grass and there's no proper walk path. Therefore, it's not a lovely scene. I think several improvements should be made to it in order to better accommodate to the citizens' needs. First of all, I think a children's area should be set up, so that kids can have fun in it. There should be a swing, a slide and things like that. In addition, some new paths should be built so people can keep off the grass. Finally, to meet the needs of senior citizens, the park should have some benches, and preferably a little square. By adopting these changes, the park would become a popular place among people.</p>

                <h3>1. Are there many public places in Iran?</h3><br><p>Yes, there are. Since Iran has a big population, there are many public areas for people to spend their time, such as parks, libraries, and shopping centers. These places are important because people need such places to socialize and do exercise.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Do you like to exercise in the public places, such as parks?</h3><br><p>Yes, I enjoy doing sports in the parks, because I like the open air. Compared to working out at home or in the gym, I can be closer to nature. I can even make new friends who share the same hobbies when I play basketball or football in the parks.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do older people or younger people prefer exercising in the public place?</h3><br><p>In my opinion, they are equally interested. Maybe younger people prefer things like cycling, running and playing basketball when they are in the parks, whereas old people are more into playing chess. I don't think one age group likes it more than<br>
                another.</p>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>I remember this happened a year ago. At that time, I applied for a part time job as a staff member in Iran Khodro. I got the chance for the interview with the plant manager, and that was the situation in which I had to be really polite, otherwise, I wouldn't be recruited. So, on that day, I put on a business casual outfit and arrived about 15 minutes earlier than the agreed interview time. The interview actually took place in Iran Khodro, but as it was about 3 pm on a weekday, there weren't many people. I sat across the table from the manager. And I was extremely cautious about every movement I made, trying not to mess things up. I used very polite language to address him, and answered all the questions in a very formal fashion. In the end, I passed the interview successfully. The manager said I did very well in that interview later at work. It was a helpful experience for me.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Should people show politeness to friends?</h3><br><p>The basic politeness is needed. You know, like respecting their private space and do not inquire about their personal affairs. We each is an independent individual, has our own minds and thoughts.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Are Iranian people becoming much politer or not?</h3><br><p>I think people are mostly polite nowadays as they were in the past. Iranian people have a long tradition of being polite to each other. Though life is becoming more casual, the overall education level is improving, so people are maintaining this merit of showing politeness.</p>
                <br><h3>3. In what ways do Iranian people show politeness?</h3><br><p>There are various ways. For example, people call their seniors at work and older people "Shoma", which is a more respectful way to say you than "To". And we speak to others politely by putting ourselves in a lower status than the person we speak to. We also provide better seats at meetings or dinner tables for people we respect.</p>
                <br><h3>4. What are the uncivilized manners on public transportation?</h3><br><p>I've noticed some behaviors that are quite inappropriate. For example, some people talk very loudly on trains or buses, which disturbs other people. Also, I've seen some young people who were not willing to offer their seats to older people. It's a shame.</p>

            <h2><a href="">A skill that takes a long time to learn</a></h2>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a skill that takes a long time to learn</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:<br>
                • What skill it is<br>
                • How and where you can learn it<br>
                • Why it takes a long time to learn<br>
                And explain how is it beneficial for the future</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>I’m going to tell you about a skill that takes a long time to learn, and that is playing a<br>
                musical instrument, or more specifically, playing the guitar. There are many ways you<br>
                can learn to play the guitar but I guess the most common way is to get guitar lessons<br>
                from a guitar teacher. I think you can find a guitar teacher in just about any town or<br>
                city because it’s probably one of the most popular musical instruments to learn. And if<br>
                you can’t find a teacher nearby where you live, then there are tons of online learning<br>
                resources that you can learn from. Personally, I think learning with a teacher in a face to<br>
                face lesson is probably the most effective but expensive method. But if you can’t afford<br>
                private lessons, there are many cheap or even free websites to learn from.<br>
                Learning to play the guitar is something that takes a long time because there are many<br>
                aspects involved. For example, you must learn some basic music theories about notes,<br>
                chords, and rhythm, among many other things. Then you must learn how to apply that<br>
                knowledge to the guitar, for example, you must know where all the notes are on the<br>
                guitar and what notes to play when you want to play a specific chord. And lastly, you<br>
                must be able to actually physically play those notes and chords, with rhythm. Playing<br>
                the guitar involves both your hands doing different things at the same time, which can<br>
                be very difficult to become good at and takes a lot of practise. Actually, at first it is very<br>
                difficult to play something on the guitar that actually sounds good, and many people<br>
                give up quickly because they lose motivation when they can’t see any improvement<br>
                in a short period of time. But, like any skill worth knowing, you must understand that<br>
                practice makes perfect.<br>
                I guess some people would say that this skill isn’t really beneficial for the future, but I<br>
                would say that music is an important part of most people’s lives. So, whether you can<br>
                play the guitar, or if you simply love to listen to music, then probably sometimes in the<br>
                future, your guitar or someone else’s guitar is going to have some kind of positive affect<br>
                on your and other people’s mood or emotions.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Why does it take a lot of time to learn a skill?</h3><br><p>Well, I think it normally takes a long time to learn a new skill simply because it takes<br>
                time for our brains and our bodies to adapt to the new skill we are trying to learn. For<br>
                example, when you want to learn how to play the guitar, it takes quite a long time before<br>
                the muscles in your hands and fingers are developed enough to be able to move quickly<br>
                and precisely in order for you to be able to press the correct strings in the correct place<br>
                to play the sounds you want the guitar to make. So, basically it just takes time because<br>
                our brains and bodies need time to adapt to the new skill, but some people can adapt<br>
                faster than others at different skills</p>
                <br><h3>2. Is it important to learn a new skill?</h3><br><p>Definitely. I think life is about learning. So, if you are not learning and practising a new skill<br>
                then probably you are not challenging yourself, and you might even find life a little boring.<br>
                I think in order to have a fulfilling life, it is important to learn new skills all the time. </p>
                <br><h3>3. What do people feel when they have to wait?</h3><br><p>Well, everyone is different I guess. Some people have more patience than others, so<br>
                probably they feel fine when they have to wait, while some people can be very impatient<br>
                and probably get very frustrated when they have to wait for a long time. I guess it just<br>
                depends on what they are waiting for and how long they have to wait. </p>
                <br><h3>4. What do young people and old people do while waiting?</h3><br><p>Well, I suppose that most young people just spend time staring at their smartphone<br>
                when they have to wait for something, scrolling through their Facebook newsfeed,<br>
                while elderly people probably tend to have a conversation with each other, talk about<br>
                the weather, or read the news. Actually I really don’t have any clear idea what old people<br>
                do while waiting for something.</p>

                <h3>Describe a time someone gave you money as a gift </h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:<br>
                When you received money<br>
                • Who the person was<br>
                • Why he/she gave you money<br>
                And how did you feel about the gift</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>Let me tell you about the time my parents gave me some money as a present.<br>
                So you know during Tet holiday, adults often give children red envelopes with paper<br>
                money inside. Traditionally, these notes are a bless for a new year of good health, luck<br>
                and happiness. However, this custom has become something ugly as many children do<br>
                not understand such gestures and think of these gifts as nothing more than some extra<br>
                pocket money. I was no exception.<br>
                For years, my parents have always been the most generous people when it comes to the<br>
                amount of money I received in these red envelopes. Sometimes they gave me a million<br>
                VND, which was like a fortune to a kid at the time. However, about five to six years ago,<br>
                when I received a two dollar note, which was about 40 thousand VND, from my parent’s<br>
                envelope, I was super disappointed. No further explanations were given for the lost of<br>
                the lion share of my “income” during Tet that year.<br>
                Once I have to start giving out money, I begin to understand what my parents was<br>
                trying to teach me. Kids need to realize that lucky money are only meant for good<br>
                luck. I hated to see that the first thing many kids do after receiving my envelopes is to<br>
                immediately check how much they “earn”. My future kids, therefore, should not expect<br>
                a thick envelope from me during Tet.</p>

                <h3>1. Do you think money management skills are important?</h3><br><p>Absolutely. Knowing how to manage money properly is an essential life skill, you know.<br>
                It helps us avoid getting into financial issues in the future. For example, many people<br>
                cannot stop themselves from purchasing unnecessary items , you know. A person who<br>
                have great money management skills, on the other hand, will save up some money in<br>
                case of emergencies.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Do you think cash will be replaced by credit cards in the future?</h3><br><p>I believe payment by cash will be a thing of the past. Most developed nations has<br>
                managed to establish cashless societies where credit cards or mobile payment are<br>
                morecommonly used than cash. Cashless payment needs a boost in Vietnam since<br>
                most Vietnamese people are still used to carrying a lot of money at all times.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a time that you saved money for something</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>When it was<br>
                    Why you saved money<br>
                    How much you saved<br>
                    And explain how you felt about it</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>Earlier this year, I saved money for a new computer I wanted to buy. Because I've had my old computer for 3 years, it became quite slow, which was annoying. So, I decided to buy the brand-new MacBook Pro. As a university student, I didn't have much money, the computer was a big expense for me. Therefore, I had to be on a budget. This is what I did: I made a plan for how much I could spend in terms of meals. I spent no more than 3000 Toomans per day on my food for two months, and I didn't eat any snacks. Every time I went shopping, I only bought the basic necessities, like stationary and toothpaste. When my friends asked me out for parties, I would politely turn them down, because I know parties meant all my previous savings were in vain. I even kept a record of all my spending on a phone app, so I could better monitor it. Those two months seemed very long, but when I finally bought the MacBook, I felt it was worth the effort.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. What are the consequences of not saving money?</h3><br><p>I cannot get what I want for good. For instance, if I fancy Isfahan for a long time, and I really want to see the famous sights there, such as Chehel-Sotoon and Polle-Khajou. I have to save money for my plane tickets and my accommodation, otherwise Isfahan would always remain a dream to me.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Do you agree with the idea that the more you save, the better life will be?</h3><br><p>No, I don't think so. Saving more means enjoying less. I cannot go to the music concerts that fascinate me. I cannot have beautiful dresses which impress me and I cannot go on the walking tours which relax me. The best way is keeping both ends meet, seize the day and carpe diem.</p>
                <br><h3>3. What is the best way of saving money?</h3><br><p>Among the many ways of saving money, I think the most effective way is to increase your income, because when you are making more money, you will have more money left by the end of the month even if you don't try very hard to save it. But of course, we have to work hard to get a promotion in the first place.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Why do some people like to save money?</h3><br><p>There're different reasons for saving money. Some people think saving money is a virtue, while other people may be short of funds for something they want to purchase. There are also people who just feel more secure if they have saved up enough money in their bank account.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do young Iranians like to save money?</h3><br><p>I think it depends on their financial status. For people from rich families, they don't really have to save, and they spend a lot of money on expensive clothes, luxury bags or even fancy cars. But generally speaking, the majority of young people save money because they are not financially well-off at this stage of life.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a time that you were late</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>When it was<br>
                    What time you arrived<br>
                    Why you were late<br>
                    And explain how you felt</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>A year ago, in order to save money, I bought a cheap flight for my trip to Mashhad. The flight was to take off at 7 am, which was very early. I got up at half past four to get ready. The airport was about a one-hour drive from where I lived, so I could have caught my plane. Unfortunately, the taxi I ordered from the day before arrived about 20 minutes late to pick me up. So even though the driver drove very fast, we arrived at the terminal at around 6:30. The personnel told me that the boarding gate for my flight had already been closed. I was very frustrated when I heard this. I called the airline and they told me I could pay an extra fee of about 80000 Toomans for another flight which was to take off 3 hours later. There was nothing I could do but to pay that money. So, I have never bought any early flights. I don't want to be in a rush and risk missing my flight again.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Would you forgive those who are late?</h3><br><p>It depends on the actual situation. If it's a very important appointment or meeting, then I won't be happy about it. But if it's just a casual meeting, then I can tolerate and forgive those who are late.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What would you do if others are late?</h3><br><p>Well, for important meetings or interviews, I would make good use of the time to prepare for the upcoming event. But for my friends, I might urge them to be quick, or I would just listen to some music to kill time.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Why do some people are used to being late?</h3><br><p>If they are used to being late, then they probably weren't taught the importance of being punctual. These people may find excuses every time they are late. In this case, they should learn how to respect other people by not wasting people's precious time.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Would you like to make plans or just let things happen?</h3><br><p>I'd like to make plans. For example, in order to get high marks in final examinations, I do some preparation beforehand. I would search the internet, read the related information and buy Past Years' Exam Papers. So, I will definitely have a thorough plan for what I want to do.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do you think it's important to be punctual?</h3><br><p>Yes, I think it is very important to be punctual. At work, for instance, if I were late every day during my internship, then I would not stay long in the company. At a party, if I weren't there on time, and everybody waited, the meals became cold, then it wouldn't be a happy gathering.</p>

                <h3>Describe a time you helped someone</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:<br>
                • Who you helped and why<br>
                • How you helped this person<br>
                • What the result was<br>
                and explain how you felt about helping this person.</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>Alright let me tell you about the time that I helped my girlfriend learn IELTS.<br>
                So this happened about a couple of months ago when she was about to retake her IELTS<br>
                test after an unsucessful attempt earlier. She failed at speaking (only 6.5), so she asked<br>
                me to communicate in English for a week prior to her exam to practice. I thought it was<br>
                silly at first, but went along anyway.<br>
                I struggled a lot during our first conversations as talking in another language makes me<br>
                feel distant, even though I’m an English teacher. How ironic! Finally, I came to my senses<br>
                and decided to treat her as one of my students. Things started to get better and I was<br>
                able to detect her biggest issue in speaking: her fluency. Similar to other Vietnamese<br>
                English teachers, she focuses too much on perfecting her speech: adding “big” words<br>
                and avoiding grammatical mistakes, which eventually leads to a loss of fluency. I gave<br>
                her few tips, one of which was to stop worrying about speaking the first things off<br>
                the top of her head because speaking is a test of your communication skills, not your<br>
                vocabulary bank. Forturnately, she began to speak more fluently and achieved 8.5 in her<br>
                speaking test.<br>
                I feel pretty proud of myself as a teacher and also pretty happy for my girlfriend as she<br>
                was able to speak her mind and got the score she deserved !</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Is this necessary to ask for advice? </h3><br><p>Yes, we are not Mr. Know-it-all, I mean, there are always limits in our knowledge and<br>
                experience about things in life, so I think it’s really vital for us to ask for advice from other<br>
                people when we’re going to experience something new, taking up a new hobby, for example. </p>
                <br><h3>2. Do young people nowadays like to receive advice? </h3><br><p>It’s hard to tell, to be honest, I mean, it really depends. Some of them are very open to advice<br>
                but some don’t. They think they are always right and refuse all kinds of help from others. </p>
                <br><h3>3. Do they always follow the advice they receive?</h3><br><p>Well, again it really depends. For instance, if they find the advice valuable, they will definitely<br>
                act on it, but if they consider it to be something wrong, they will not follow it. Still there are<br>
                some cases when they pretend to take the advice to please others but then never follow it. </p>
                <br><h3>4. Should people ask for advice only on their personal matters or even important decisions?</h3><br><p>I think it doesn’t matter what the problem is, the important thing is whether they can sort<br>
                it out themselves or not. If they can’t think of any solution then I think they definitely need<br>
                advice. </p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a toy you had in your childhood</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>When you had the toy<br>
                    Who gave you the toy<br>
                    What it was like<br>
                    And explain how you felt about the toy</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>One of the toys I had as a child was a remote-control toy car. My uncle gave it to me on my birthday, probably my seventh birthday. It was quite big actually, about 40 centimeters long and 20 centimeters wide and it was of a slightly reddish color. The overall appearance of the car was very cool, and it looked really dynamic. There was a remote control that came with it, which was for controlling the movement of the car, obviously. There was something like a joystick on the control, as well as 3 buttons. I remember when I first got it, I was so happy that I jumped into the air. And every day after school, I would take it to the park near my home to show it to my friends, because I was so proud. My dad told me it was good for my hand and eye coordination. It took me about half a year until I got bored with it, but it' s one of the best toys I had.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Do girls and boys like the same toys?</h3><br><p>No, I don't think so. Normally, girls prefer something cute, Barbie dolls, for example. Girls can dress them with beautiful clothes or shinning earrings and the pink head bands, making the dolls look like princesses while boys are different. They like something stronger and powerful, like cars, guns or the superman toys.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What do you think of the advantages and disadvantages of having too many toys at home?</h3><br><p>I want to say disadvantages first. I have a nephew who is having too many toys at home. My aunt has to put them in order every time he meddles with his toys. Besides, the prices of quality toys are shocking high. So, having too many toys at home is a waste of time and money. With regards to advantages, I think having what they desired would make them much happier. It is really a luxury.</p>
                <br><h3>3. What can parents do if they can't afford a toy for their kids?</h3><br><p>If they can't afford a toy, they can make one themselves. Some toys are easy to make, and there are tutorials online, so it's practical for parents to do so. The toys parents make are even more meaningful because children can see the effort their parents put into it. So, they will cherish them.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do children like to play with toys or computer games nowadays?</h3><br><p>An increasing number of children prefer playing computer games these days, which I believe is bad news for the toy business. The computer games for children are designed very interactive and they suit children's preference, but being addicted to playing computer games is harmful for their eyes and their studies.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Why do children like to have toys in their life?</h3><br><p>Toys such as toy cars or Barbie dolls are fun for children. Because children are full of curiosity about the world, toys offer them a way to use their hands as well as their ideas to express themselves and explore different kinds of possibilities with their capacity. </p>

                <p>Who this person is<br>
                    How often you are together<br>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>I'm going to talk about chess . I enjoy playing it with my grandfather. He is really good at it, so some chess lovers from our neighborhood sometimes come over to play with him. He was the one who taught me how to play chess . When I was young, we played two or three times a week because we lived together. Since I went to high school, I'd been busy with schoolwork till I graduated from university. Therefore, I couldn't play as often as before. Now, I hardly ever play with my grandfather, because I go to school in another city. We only play about two or three times a year, I guess. And of course, my skills can't possibly match my grandfather's. But it brings back my childhood memories whenever I play it with him. He is getting older and less healthy, I wish I could have more time to be with him. Playing chess is also an activity that practices our brains which is beneficial, especially for older people.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Do people nowadays spend less quality time with their family?</h3><br><p>Yes. I think so. Nowadays, our leisure time is stolen by the mass media, such as mobile phones, computers, television and the newspapers. In Iran, most teenagers prefer chatting on the Internet or texting their friends as their free time activities. And our parents like to watch TV or listen to the radio in their spare time. So, we barely have any chance to spend quality time with each other.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Do Iranian families like to arrange indoor or outdoor activities?</h3><br><p>For my family, for instance, we like to arrange indoor activities. My family is large, with more than ten people. So, it's tricky for the seniors if we do outdoor activities, such as going hiking or summer outing, they have to prepare meals in advance and take care of the juniors all the time along the road. While arranging indoor activities is much simpler. We usually have a meal at home together on a regular basis, then watch TV and chew the fat. I think it is a good way to improve our relationship.</p>
                <br><h3>3. What's the most important thing that young people can learn from old people?</h3><br><p>I think the most important thing that young people can learn is how to make important decisions. Young people tend to make impulsive decisions due to lack of experience. And because old people have very rich life experience, they can show young people what things to consider before making crucial decisions.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do young people like to live with old people in your country?</h3><br><p>I don't think so. Young people and old people usually have very different lifestyles, so they are not likely to get along very well. In order to avoid problems caused by generation gap, young people prefer living with people their own age.</p>
                <br><h3>5. How much time should parents spend with their children every day?</h3><br><p>It depends on the children's age. For younger kids, parents should spend more time taking care of them and accompanying them, so the children can get more love from their parents. But for older kids or teenagers, parents can spend less time with them, so they can be more independent.</p>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>The important event that I remember celebrating was when my family moved into our new apartment. This happened a year ago in my hometown, in Shiraz. My family had lived in our old home for as long as I could remember. So, it was exciting for us to be able to move to a new place. We had a big house warming party. A lot of relatives from our extended family were invited , such as my uncles, aunts and cousins . There were about 15 people altogether. The house was decorated with balloons and everything. It was of a very lively atmosphere. People were all talking and eating at the table. My relatives all said our new home was beautiful and comfortable. I felt really happy and excited that day because it was one of the rare occasions when our big family could get together. We took a group photo together after dinner and this photo is kept in my family album. It reminds me of the wonderful party that day.</p>

                <h3>1. What is the most important thing for being a teenager?</h3><br><p>In my view, the most important part for being a teenager is that not afraid of being a loser. To be young, means having thousands of possibilities. We can try whatever we want. I mean, trying different jobs to find what really obsesses us and stick to it in the rest of our life.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What events do Iranian people like to celebrate?</h3><br><p>I think we like to celebrate for important matters like the birth of a new child, the marriage of a new couple or something like that. We will never miss out a celebration when anything happy happens.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do you like to plan for an important meeting or activity?</h3><br><p>To be honest, I'm not really the kind of person who plans things very carefully. I prefer playing it by ear. But if it's an important occasion, I will let someone else do the planning and I take active part in it.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Who is the most important person in your life?</h3><br><p>The most important people in my life are my family members. They are the ones who would be there to help me and support me when I'm faced with difficulties and challenges. Their unconditional love drives me forward and I try my best to love and protect them.</p>
                <br><h3>5. In your country, do you think good appearance is important while finding a job?</h3><br><p>I have to admit that appearance is a factor that interviewers will take into account from candidates, especially for jobs like store clerks, because they will directly meet the customers and clients. However, I think the most important quality is not having a good appearance, but the ability to perform the tasks at work with good efficiency.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe an important skill which cannot be learned at school</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>What the skill is<br>
                    Why it cannot be learned at school<br>
                    why it is important<br>
                    And explain how we learned it</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>The skill that I think is important is how to take care of our home. Sadly, it's not really something we can learn at school, since it's not in the university syllabus. Schools are more focused on specific areas which will benefit us in our future work. However, when it comes to taking care of our home, one has to refer to other channels. This skill includes basic things like how to cook a simple meal, how to pay bills, how to tidy the rooms and how to manage the household budgets. These are actually very important for overall life satisfaction, because if we don't know how to handle these issues, our life will be a mess. Fortunately, there are many ways for us to sharpen this skill. Life itself is the best and perhaps the only classroom for it. Only by really experiencing these things can we master this useful skill which will benefit us for a lifetime. I' m now quite good at since I became aware of its importance.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. What kind of skills are popular in your country?</h3><br><p>Nursing, translating and computer programming. Firstly, Iran has the largest number of people in the region, with around ten million aging population, which requires plenty of nursing staff. Secondly, our foreign trade is continuously expanding, thus requires a large quantity of language talents. Thirdly, technology has revolutionized the way we live, nearly everything we do now is related to computer, so programming is quite popular in Iran.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Does technology deeply affect people's life?</h3><br><p>It definitely does. Technology has changed many aspects of our life in different ways. We rely on technology to improve our work efficiency and life quality. For example, computers and smartphones have become so common that they are indispensable in our life.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Is it necessary for teenagers to learn to use computers?</h3><br><p>Yes. I think so. Computers are very useful tools in modern world. Learning some basic computer skills is necessary for everybody, so that they can work and live with better efficiency. Teenagers can learn to use computers very fast and they can use computers to search for useful information online for their studies or hobbies.</p>
                <br><h3>4. What skill do you want to learn soon?</h3><br><p>I want to learn some basic coding. Since online business is so popular these days, there's a big demand for coders in the job market. And even if I don't become a computer programmer, this skill is a strong plus in this information age.</p>
                <br><h3>5. What qualities do you think are the most important for work?</h3><br><p>I think the most important qualities for work are passion and integrity. If people have passion, they are always ready to function, and they are more productive than others. Integrity is also a very important trait, since honesty is the best policy for everything we do. We can gain people's trust, and that is one of the keys to success.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Good service</a></h2>
            <dd style="display: block;">
                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a good service you received</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>What the service was<br>
                    When and where you received the service<br>
                    Whom you were together with<br>
                    And explain why you think it was a good service </p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p> I received this great service on a plane. It was half a year ago when I flew from Tehran to Shiraz with my dad. Even though it was summer, we felt cold once we boarded the plane because of the air conditioning in the cabin. The flight attendants brought everybody a small blanket, so we didn't feel cold anymore. Later, when the food and beverages were served, there were big smiles on all cabin crew's faces. And they spoke to us in a very gentle and elegant manner, asking us what we would like to eat and drink. Unlike some other airlines, they offered passengers more food choices . For drinks, they had tea, coffee, apple juice, lemonade, mineral water, so it could cater to the needs of different passengers . Later, I felt thirsty again and I turned on the service light. A flight attendant came quickly, asking about my needs, then returned with a bottle of water. Both my dad and I were very satisfied with that service. So that airline has been my first choice when I buy plane tickets.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Would you like to work in the service industry in the future?</h3><br><p>No. I'm quite satisfied with my current job. I'd like to continue progressing in this field and see myself in a more senior role. Besides, this position gives me the opportunity to gain new skills and techniques which will help me to advance. So, for the moment, I won't consider other choices.</p>
                <br><h3>2. Why do some older people want to be waiters in the big cities?</h3><br><p>Some senior citizens feel lonely being at home all day, especially those without children around. They want to continue their work or do some simple ones, such as waiters, to show their value and to get together with their fellow members who have the common interests and equal free time.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do you think that all the waiters should be given training classes?</h3><br><p>Yes. Waiters are very important staff in restaurants. They directly provide service to the customers. So, in order to offer satisfactory service and build a good reputation for the restaurants, waiters should be given adequate training classes. For example, they should be trained to talk politely and even serve the food in a graceful manner.</p>
                <br><h3>4. How do you deal with impolite waiters?</h3><br><p>If I encountered an impolite waiter, I would make a complaint to the restaurant manager. I think the manager will listen to me and stand on my vantage point in order to maintain a good reputation for the restaurant. Maybe I could even get a free dessert for helping them improve their service.</p>
                <br><h3>5. What kinds of service are not good?</h3><br><p>In my opinion, the ones that are slow and the ones that need the customers to explain their issue multiple times are bad. Just imagine that you have to wait for more than half an hour before the food is served at a restaurant, or that you need to tell the agent to change the plan over and over again before he or she gets it right. These kinds of service are totally unbearable.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe something you learned in a place or from someone</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>What it was<br>
                    Where or from whom you learned it<br>
                    What the situation was<br>
                    And explain how you felt about it </p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>One thing I learned quite recently is cooking fish. I learned it from my roommate. She is quite experienced in cooking as she started to learn it since she was in middle school. The food she cooks is so delicious that I even gained weight after we became roommates, which is the side effect. One weekend, we stayed home, and she cooked this fish dish for lunch. It was so yummy. I'd never had anything like it. So, I asked her to teach me how to make it, and she agreed joyfully. So, I bought another fish for dinner that day. She gave me instructions on how to prepare it step by step. I had to really concentrate so that I didn't miss a thing and I followed exactly what she told me to do. In the end, the wonderful smell coming from the dish made my mouth water. It was a little too salty, but I was satisfied. Now, I've cooked that fish dish many times, so I'm much better at it. When I cooked it for my family, they were really amazed.</p>

                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. Do you like to teach others?</h3><br><p>Honestly speaking, I am not a patient person. If I teach others how to do something, and they don't understand what I was saying. I will be a little upset and lose my interest soon. So, in this way, you can say that I don't like to teach others. But there are lees to every wine. And I am trying to get over it little by little.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What is the most effective way for self- learning?</h3><br><p>As far as I am concerned, watching related videos and writing down key points is the most effective way for self-learning. The development of Internet did bring countless comfort and convenience to our life. And one is that we have access to any program that interests us. Then we can pay for them and begin self-learning.</p>
                <br><h3>3. How can we help old people learn?</h3><br><p>I think the most important thing is that we have to be patient. Older people usually have poorer eyesight and hearing, so it might be necessary for us to explain the target knowledge to them over and over again. Besides, we should use more body language and demonstrative approaches, instead of using all those multimedia gadgets.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do people in your country like to take online courses?</h3><br><p>Online courses are gaining popularity these years, due to its convenience and reasonable price. Many people are now taking online English classes with foreign tutors at the convenience of staying at home. I think this trend will continue to grow in the future.</p>
                <br><h3>5. What kinds of teaching methods are suitable for old people?</h3><br><p>I think the face-to-face teaching is the most suitable method for teaching old people. Unlike young people, old people are not as good with computer and other gadgets, so it's better to use the more down-to-earth approach which involves more illustration as well as demonstration. </p>

                <div class="dark">Part 2</div>
                <h3>Describe a time when someone visited your home</h3>
                <p></p><p>You should say:</p>
                <p>Who he or she was<br>
                    When it happened<br>
                    What you did<br>
                    And explain how you felt about the visit </p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p></p><p>When I was in the third year of high school, once my teacher visited my home. She was responsible for recording performance of all students in the class. I was very nervous at that time because I was afraid that my parents and my teacher would tell each other about my bad performance or behavior both at home and school. When my teacher arrived at the door, I introduced her to my parents. After that I made her a cup of tea. I tried to behave very politely. Then we all sat at the table, and I knew the critical moment had come. I was ready to be the subject of their conversation. But it was a relief that the talk turned out to be quite casual. Both parties said they were pleased about me, although they did think I should make more effort in my studies, especially in my math. Before my teacher left, I thanked her for paying us a visit. This experience was memorable for me.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="dark">Part 3</div>
                <h3>1. What time do you think is suitable for visiting?</h3><br><p>It varies. If the friend I am going to visit is free during the day and occupied at night, then a daytime visit is a good choice, and vice versa. I don't want to ruin the good chance of being together and relaxing ourselves.</p>
                <br><h3>2. How do you make new friends?</h3><br><p>I think I'm quite easy to get along with, so whenever I come to a different place, I will always make new friends. For example, during the five-day internship at a provincial department of commerce, I met some lovely and excellent friends. We shared common interests. We like binge watching and like doing outdoor activities. So, most of the time we stayed together and naturally we became friends.</p>
                <br><h3>3. Do young people like to visit their friends nowadays?</h3><br><p>Well, I don't think young people visit each other a lot, because they don't usually have their own places. They either stay with their parents or roommates. So, they prefer going out for fun together, like going to a movie.</p>
                <br><h3>4. What do Iranian people usually do when hanging out together?</h3><br><p>There are all sorts of things people can do together. I think the most popular ones are eating out in the restaurants, going to movies, shopping and hiking. We never run out of things to do as long as we are with the right people.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do you think technology has brought us closer or not?</h3><br><p>Generally speaking, yes. We now have more ways to stay in touch thanks to the advancement of technology. Everybody has a smartphone now. We also travel much faster than before because of the planes and high-speed trains, so we get to see our friends and family more. So, I think technology has brought us closer.</p>

                <br>
                <p></p><p>My favorite season of the year is summer. In our country, summer usually starts in mid-June and ends in mid September. It is the warmest season of the whole year, or you can say it's the hottest, which means I don't have to wear heavy clothes. Apart from that, summer is also a perfect time for water sports. I'm fond of different kinds of water sports, swimming, snorkeling, surfing, to name just a few. So, every summer, I go to the pool two or three times a week. I really enjoy dipping myself in the water. Whenever I have a chance, I go to the beach. Besides, we also have the longest holiday from school in summer, about two months long. So, we can also go traveling with friends or family. Last summer, my friends and I went to Ardebil. We ate lots of delicious ice creams there. For these reasons, summer is the season that I love the most.</p>

                <h3>1. What can we do to stop greenhouse effect?</h3><br><p>To stop the rise of global warming, we can take public transportation instead of driving cars, and prefer environmental-friendly shopping bags rather than disposable plastic bags. Last but not the least, value rainforests and sustainable agriculture.</p>
                <br><h3>2. What are the possible results if temperature continues going up?</h3><br><p>As far as I am concerned, with a gradual increase in the average temperature, lakes will be disappearing, then our drinking water supply is at risk. Weather will be worsening, then our grocery prices are spiking. Bark beetles will double, then the mountain trees are dooming. All in all, the climate change will bring grave consequences.</p>
                <br><h3>3. How do you feel about the climate in recent years?</h3><br><p>I think the air pollution is getting worse, so the weather in winter is really terrible, especially in big cities, where the sky is always gray. But I don't think global warming is affecting us that much, because the winters are still quite cold in recent years.</p>
                <br><h3>4. Do you like to go outside when winter comes?</h3><br><p>Actually, I do. I kind of like cold weather, especially when it snows. I can go out and build a snowman or have a snowball fight with my friends. I just have to put on very warm clothes, maybe also a hat and mittens so I won't catch a cold.</p>
                <br><h3>5. Do you think weather has an influence on people's mood?</h3><br><p>Definitely. I think most people will feel somewhat gloomy or down if it keeps raining for days and nights, and when the weather clears up, they will feel happy because they can finally go out and do outdoor activities.</p>
